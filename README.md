# watchall

watchall executes a program periodically, showing output fullscreen same as linux watch command
but with scrolling feature. This repo is a copy of watchall from [pip](https://pypi.org/project/watchall/). 
The original version does not run with Python 3 due to a Python 2 print-bracket-issue.
